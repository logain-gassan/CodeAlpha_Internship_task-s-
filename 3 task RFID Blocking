 This is a simple example for demonstration purposes, and it might not be suitable for real-world security applications.

```

**Explanation:**

* **RFID Reader:**  You'll need an RFID reader module, such as an RC522 module. This module communicates with the RFID tags.
* **RFID Blocker:**  In this simple example, a piece of metal sheet acts as a Faraday Cage. This metal sheet will disrupt the radio waves emitted by the RFID tags, preventing the reader from receiving them.
* **LED Indicator:**  The LED is connected to the output pin of the RFID reader.  When the reader detects an RFID tag (without the blocker), the LED will light up. 

**Code (Arduino Example):**

```cpp
#include <SPI.h>
#include <MFRC522.h>

#define SS_PIN 10
#define RST_PIN 9

MFRC522 rfid(SS_PIN, RST_PIN);

const int LED_PIN = 13;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  SPI.begin();
  rfid.PCD_Init();
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  if (rfid.PICC_IsNewCardPresent()) {
    if (rfid.PICC_ReadCardSerial()) {
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); 
      Serial.print("Card detected: ");
      Serial.print(rfid.uid.uidByte[0]);
      for (byte i = 1; i < rfid.uid.size; i++) {
        Serial.print(' ');
        Serial.print(rfid.uid.uidByte[i]);
      }
      Serial.println();
      
      rfid.PICC_HaltA();
      rfid.PICC_WakeupA();
      delay(1000);
    }
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  }
}
```

**GitHub Repository:**

1. **Create a GitHub repository:**  Create a new repository on GitHub, for example, "RFID-Blocking-Example".
2. **Add files:**  Create a folder named "src" and add the Arduino code file within it (e.g., "rfid_blocking.ino").
3. **README.md:**  Create a `README.md` file in the repository root with the following information:

    ```
    # RFID Blocking Example

    This is a basic example of an RFID blocking circuit that uses a metal sheet as a Faraday cage to disrupt the communication between an RFID reader and RFID tags. 

    ## Circuit Diagram:

    [Include the circuit diagram here]

    ## Code:

    The Arduino code is provided in the `src/rfid_blocking.ino` file.

    ##  How to Use:

    1. Connect the RFID reader (e.g., RC522) to the Arduino board.
    2. Connect the LED to the output pin of the RFID reader.
    3. Place a metal sheet near the RFID reader.
    4. Upload the code to your Arduino.
    5. Place an RFID tag (e.g., a credit card) near the reader.

    ## Results:

    - When the RFID tag is near the reader without the metal sheet, the LED will light up, indicating a successful read.
    - When the RFID tag is near the reader with the metal sheet blocking the radio waves, the LED will not light up.

    ##  Notes:

    - This is a basic demonstration. For real-world security applications, more robust RFID blocking solutions are required.
    - This example uses an Arduino, but you can adapt it to other microcontroller platforms.

4. **Commit and push:**  Save your changes and commit them to your repository. Push your code to GitHub.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Security:** This example is a simple demonstration and may not be effective against all types of RFID readers or scanners. For real-world applications, consider using commercially available RFID blocking materials and more advanced techniques.
* **Legal Considerations:**  Be aware that using RFID blocking technology might be illegal or restricted in certain locations. Check your local regulations before implementing this technology.
